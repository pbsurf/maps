*Fork of Tangram ES for use with [Ascend Maps](https://www.github.com/styluslabs/maps)*

Compatibility with upstream will be restored in the future.

Major changes include:
* 3D terrain support (incl. label occlusion, sky, etc.)
* eliminating duplicate tile loads (when a source is used multiple times)
* tile level-of-detail based on screen area (in pixels**2)
* try proxy tile if tile loading fails (for better offline support)
* TIFF and LERC raster support
* GLES 3 support
* support for native scene style functions (performance improvement over JS)
* support for MBTiles as cache for online source, incl. last access tracking and max-age
* optional fallback marker shown when a marker is hidden by collision
* support for zoom_offset < 0 (for better satellite imagery resolution when pixel scale > 1)
* contour line label support
* support JS function for generating tile URL (per tile)
* $latitude, $longitude in scene style for location dependent styling adjustments
* support SVG images embedded in scene style (with external SVG renderer, e.g., nanosvg)
* support for fixed boolean values in filters to allow use of scene globals
* canceling all URL requests when destroying Scene
* misc optimizations based on profiling
* support plain makefile build
* fix some proxy tile issues (e.g. cycles)
* fix some issues when very large number of labels present
* fix some crashes related to async Scene destruction

Dependency changes:
* make glm and stb submodules
* absorb tangrams/* submodules
* replace SQLiteCpp with simple single header (200LOC) sqlite C++ wrapper
* replace old yaml-cpp with custom yaml/json library (crashes due to non-atomic ref counting in tangrams/yaml-cpp)

Tangram ES is a C++ library for rendering 2D and 3D maps from vector data using OpenGL ES. It is a counterpart to [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram).

This repository contains both the core rendering library and sample applications that use the library on Android, iOS, macOS, Ubuntu, Windows, and Raspberry Pi.
